## 📦 Deployment
To publish the Hackbank application required a Google and Apple developer account. To make the build I used EAS (Expo Application Services).

## 🏛️ History

I started this app at a Starbucks, while I wanted to send money I found that my transaction was going to be delayed. So I had the idea to create an application that could predict how a transaction would behave from one bank to another bank.

## 🎨 UI Design
I started to create the sketches of the design in Figma. I designed four screens, one for the splash screen, another for the form, another for the result and for the information page (with contact).
